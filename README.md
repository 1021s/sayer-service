Hack Reactor Senior Front End Capstone project (FEC) - Zillow
This is a group project, but all the work herein is my own, and the project will
be a coupling of our individual components to make up a whole page.


This module represents the Zestimator from the Zillow website,
  in this case, a house listing information section.

Setup scripts:

 - npm run db:setup - seed the database
 - npm run dev:react - runs webpack to build bundle
 - npm start - starts server to host page at localhost:3003/
